I learnt 
git init
git status
git add file name 
git commit -m "message"
git log
git diff
git rm --cached "filename"
git branch "name"
git branch -d "name" -- delete branach
git checkout "branchname"  -- to move to the branch
git switch "branchname"
git merge "branchname"
git pull origin branch name -- to get the updated file and merge to the to git repo from remote repo-- merge + ftech
git fetch -- to get the updated file without merge
git merge - to merge the data
git stash - to move the file to hidd after staging to git
git stash pop - to get the hidden file
git stash clear to clear the hide file
git merge and rebase 
git clone "url"
merge conflict resolution
git reset --hard
git reset hashid
fork - is used to get the copy of the existing project repo, to change
fork - to get the copy of the things fromm GitHub account to our main git hub repo
git rebase -i "id" -- with the help of this we can peform quash and commit
know the squash commit -- to make the all commits to one
AND HOW TO PUSH THE CODE TO GIT REMOTE REPO

1.create a git repo
2.add any file to that repo with git add file_name
3.commit with commit keyword git commit -m "message"
4.create a branch like git branch -M main
5.add the git repo to git remote repo - git remote add origin "githuub path"
5.push the code to GitHub(remote repo) -- git push -u origin main



so a.we can use fork to get the copy of the remote repo
b.with the help of clone,we can get the clone to the local system repo
c.we can create a branches and add the additional functionality or changes 
d.if we push this request to the main branch of the upstarem main, it wont work because of the security issues so we use the pull request in git hub , that main remote repo will get that request(Pr) to approve for to merge into that the main upstream main.
